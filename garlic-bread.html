        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
            This dish needs no introduction. Just a warning not to kiss your lover after eating though...

            INGREDIENTS
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 heads garlic</li>
            <li>1 (1 pound) loaf Italian bread</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>half cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Slice the tops off of garlic heads, so the tip of each clove is exposed. Place garlic heads, cut-sides up, on a baking sheet; drizzle tops with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until garlic is soft, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set the oven to broil.</li>
            <li>Slice bread loaf in half horizontally; place cut-side up on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Squeeze garlic cloves from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir in butter, Parmesan cheese, and parsley until well blended. Spread onto the cut sides of bread.</li>
            <li>Broil bread until toasted, about 5 minutes.</li>

        </ol>
